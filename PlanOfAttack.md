# Plan of Attack


## Division of Work

### Board Game Environment

The entire team is going to work together on creating the underlying board game environment before starting to create individual games. The work on this will be split up as follows:

- 

- 

- 

#### 4 Plug-in Board Games

This is a team of 7 people. This work will be divided by having appoximately two people work on each board game. Since there is not an even number of people, two people each will work on three of the boards, while one person will work solo on the fourth game. The game that is done by the person working solo will be the easiest game to implement (most likely Tic-Tac-Toc).

The games will be divide to team members as follows:

- Tic-Tac-Toe: **Jacob Tiritilli**

- Checkers: **???** & **???**

- Chess: **???** & **???**

- Battleship: **???** & **???**

## Communication/Meeting Plan

We will mainly be using Slack for communication. This channel has already been set up. We will also be communicating by creating Issues on GitHub to keep track of bugs and set deadlines for milestones that need to be completed. This also allows for separate discussion threads to be created under each issue, keeping the communication more organized.

We plan to work mostly remotely on this project. We will touch base with eachother every class session and will organize personal meetings on a case-by-case basis.
