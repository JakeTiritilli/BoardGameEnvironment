# Plan of Attack

The development of this application will be managed through the use of Git and GitHub. The program will be written in Java 8 and will use the JavaFX platform for creating the GUI.

## Division of Work

### Board Game Environment

The entire team is going to work together on creating the underlying board game environment before starting to create individual games. The system will be designed using the MVC pattern. The work on this will be split up as follows:

- Create UI for main menu and navigation

- Create general game boards and a UI that allows for swapping out different boards for various games

- Create a back-end that serves as a framework for building board games by providing general functionality that is useful to many different types of board games

### 4 Plug-in Board Games

This is a team of 7 people. This work will be divided by having appoximately two people work on each board game. Since there is not an even number of people, two people each will work on three of the boards, while one person will work solo on the fourth game. The game that is done by the person working solo will be the easiest game to implement (most likely Tic-Tac-Toe).

The games will be divide to team members as follows:

- Tic-Tac-Toe: **Jacob Tiritilli**

- Checkers: **???** & **???**

- Chess: **Jason Alaya** & **Thu Nguyen**

- Battleship: **Matt Leong** & **???**


## Major Expected Components of System

- UML diagram describing the basic architecture

- Implementation of the model of the board game environment

- Implementation of the GUI of the board game environment

- Implementation of the model/GUI for each of the four board games


## Intermediate Deadlines/Milestones

Deadlines will be organzied through the use of a GitHub Project which will organize the process of Issue completion and display the progress of each Issue.

- **March 5:** Finish organizing "plan of attack" and solidifying group roles. Continue working on and hopefully finish the UML class diagram describing the basic architecture of the board game environment.

- **March 7:** UML diagram should be complete (although subject to modifications) and implementation of the back-end of the board game environment should be underway.

- **March 12:** Complete a working implementation of the back-end of the board game environment and begin working on the GUI for the environment that will host the various games.

- **March 14:** Continue refining board environment. Implementation of the board game evironment's GUI to host the games should be complete, although refinements can be made to better incorporate the individual board games. Work on the individual board games should have begun.

- **March 19:** Complete implementation of all of the four individual board games and their respective GUIs. Test entire application. Update UML diagram to reflect the final design.


## Communication/Meeting Plan

We will be using Slack for general communication. This channel has already been set up.

We will also be communicating by creating Issues on GitHub to keep track of bugs and set deadlines for milestones that need to be completed. This allows for separate discussion threads to be created under each issue, keeping the communication more organized. The progress of these issues is facilitated through the use of a GitHub Project which has three columns, with issues/other notes being able to be moved across columns. These columns are "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." This will help the team in being able to visualize what still needs to be completed and allow for an easy articulation of all of the required tasks.

We plan to work mostly remotely on this project. We will touch base with eachother every class session and will organize personal meetings on a case-by-case basis.
