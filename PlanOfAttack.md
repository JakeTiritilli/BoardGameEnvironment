# Plan of Attack


## Division of Work

### Board Game Environment

The entire team is going to work together on creating the underlying board game environment before starting to create individual games. The system will be designed using the MVC pattern. The work on this will be split up as follows:

- 

- 

- 

### 4 Plug-in Board Games

This is a team of 7 people. This work will be divided by having appoximately two people work on each board game. Since there is not an even number of people, two people each will work on three of the boards, while one person will work solo on the fourth game. The game that is done by the person working solo will be the easiest game to implement (most likely Tic-Tac-Toe).

The games will be divide to team members as follows:

- Tic-Tac-Toe: **Jacob Tiritilli?**

- Checkers: **???** & **???**

- Chess: **???** & **???**

- Battleship: **???** & **???**


## Major Expected Components of System

- UML diagram describing the basic architecture

- Implementation of the model of the board game environment

- Implementation of the GUI of the board game environment

- Implementation of the model/GUI for each of the four board games


## Intermediate Deadlines/Milestones

Deadlines will be organzied through the use of a GitHub Project which will organize the process of Issue completion and display the progress.

### Deadline 1

### Deadline 2

### Deadline 3

## Communication/Meeting Plan

We will mainly be using Slack for communication. This channel has already been set up.

We will also be communicating by creating Issues on GitHub to keep track of bugs and set deadlines for milestones that need to be completed. This also allows for separate discussion threads to be created under each issue, keeping the communication more organized. The progress of these issues is facilitated through the use of a GitHub Project which has three columns, with issues/other notes being able to be moved across columns. These columns are "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." This will help the team in being able to visualize what still needs to be completed and artciculate all of the required tasks.

We plan to work mostly remotely on this project. We will touch base with eachother every class session and will organize personal meetings on a case-by-case basis.
